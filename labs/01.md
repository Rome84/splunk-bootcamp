# Reviewing and Setting Up the Environment
Time: 15 minutes
Current AMI (us-east-1): 
    - Splunk (ami-09ff2075c79703b1d)
    - NGINX (ami-049fa8e878b3acb9d)

## Instructions

In this lab, we'll review the environment, making sure that Splunk is running in the server provided. 

### Login
You'll access the server through SSH with the following credentials:

```
student|splunk

http://{{SPLUNK_HOST}}:8000/
admin|SplunkB00tcamp
```

If you need to change the Splunk password, you can do it with the following command (then restart the Splunk service and log in again):

```
sudo $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk cmd splunkd rest --noauth POST /services/admin/users/admin "password=<your password>" 
```

### Review the App
Make sure that the apps called "Destinations" and "SA-Eventgen" are already created. You can check this in the left panel of the Home page.

### Event Generator
We're using the [Eventgen](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1924/) app to simulate real-time events. Eventgen is already installed, but it's disabled. So let's enable it to start receiving events:

- Go to "Settings" (top menu)
- Then click on "Data inputs"
- In the Local Inputs section, click on "SA-Eventgen"
- Click on the "Enable" link from the status column
- Go to the "Destinations" app again. You should see that the number of events indexed is increasing.
