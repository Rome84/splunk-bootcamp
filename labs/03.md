# Upload Log Data Manually
Time: 15 minutes

## Instructions
This time, you're going to upload data manually from your local computer. You'll download some example files from Splunk, and then you'll confirm that the data has been uploaded by doing a simple search.

### Add Data Manually
Let's start by downloading the data, but don't uncompress them.

- [Download](http://docs.splunk.com/images/Tutorial/tutorialdata.zip) the tutorialdata.zip file
- [Download](http://docs.splunk.com/images/d/db/Prices.csv.zip) the Prices.csv.zip file
- Click on "Settings" and then on "Add Data"
- Click on the "Upload" box 
- Under Select Source, click the "Select File" button to browse for the file that you just downloaded in the previous steps
- Select the tutorialdata.zip file and click Open
- Click "Next" to continue to Input Settings
- Under Input Settings, override the default settings Index (you can create a new one for practice purposes)
- Let's change the Host values by selecting "Segment in path"
- Now type "1" for the segment number. this works when you want to use a part of the file path as the value for the host. For example, for "/var/log/hostname/" you'll use "3" to set the Host name.
- Click "Review"
- Click "Submit" 
- Finally, to see the data, click "Start Searching" and confirm that the data has been uploaded successfully. How many events do you see?
