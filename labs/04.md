# Use the Field Extractor Tool
Time: 10 minutes

## Instructions
There are going to be cases where the data will be uploaded as is, so Splunk will need some help to change from a simple raw log line to a more structured log (or event, in this case) so that it's easier to create search queries.

### Extract New Fields
Let's continue using the data that Eventgen is generating.

- Go to the "Destinations" app
- Run the following search: “index=main sourcetype=access_custom”
- In the left menu, scroll down a little bit and click on the "+ Extract New Fields" link
- Select one of the events displayed and click “Next”
- Click on the “Delimiters” option and click “Next”
- Choose a delimiter by clicking on the "Comma" button
- Click on the pencil icon for each field and rename the fields
- Click on “Finish”
- Click on ”Explore the fields I just created in Search”
- Do you see any difference?
