# Use the Field Extractor Tool
Time: 10 minutes

## Instructions
There are going to be cases where the data will be uploaded as is, so Splunk will need some help to change from a simple raw log line to a more structured log (or event, in this case) so that it's easier to create search queries.

### Extract New Fields
Let's continue using the data that Eventgen is generating.

- Go to the "Search & Reporting" app
- Run the following search: "index=main sourcetype=access_custom"
- In the left menu, scroll down a little bit and click on the "+ Extract New Fields" link
- Select one of the events displayed and click "Next"
- Choose "Regular Expression"
- Copy the following text into the text box:

```
^\["(?P<datetime_us>[^"]+)",\s+"(?P<datetime>[^"]+)"\],(?P<client_ip>[^,]+)[^,\n]*,(?P<http_method>\w+),(?P<http_uri>[^,]+)(?:[^\-\n]*\-){2},(?P<server_ip>\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+),(?P<http_user_agent>[^,]+),(?P<http_status_code>\d+)(?:[^,\n]*,){4}(?P<http_response_time>\d+)
```

- Click on "Next"
- Type "eventgen" as the extraction name
- Choose "All apps"
- Click on "Finish"
- Click on "Explore the fields I just created in Search"
- Do you see any difference?
