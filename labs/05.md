# Use the Forwarder to Send Metrics to Splunk
Time: 40 minutes

## Instructions
It's time to start doing more complicated things in the Splunk instance. This time, you'll install [collectd](https://collectd.org/) which is a daemon that collects performance metrics periodically from the server where it's running.

Maybe you'll use other tools, but the idea of this lab is that you can experience the process of sending logs from a server to Splunk by using a forwarder.

### Configure the HEC
In the Splunk GUI:

- Click Settings > Data Inputs
- Under Local Inputs, click HTTP Event Collector.
- Verify that HEC is enabled.
    - Click Global Settings.
    - For All Tokens, click Enabled if this button is not already selected.
    - Note the value for HTTP Port Number, which you'll need to configure collectd.
    - Click Save.
- Configure an HEC token for sending data by clicking New Token.
- On the Select Source page, for Name, enter a token name, for example "collectd token".
- Leave the other options blank or unselected.
- Click Next.
- On the Input Settings page, for Source type, click Select.
- Click Select Source Type, then select Metrics > collectd_http.
- Next to Default Index, select your metrics index, or click Create a new index to create one. If you choose to create an index, in the New Index dialog box:
    - Enter an Index Name. User-defined index names must consist of only numbers, lowercase letters, underscores, and hyphens. Index names cannot begin with an underscore or hyphen.
    - For Index Data Type, click Metrics.
    - Configure additional index properties as needed.
    - Click Save.
- Click Review, and then click Submit.
- Copy the Token Value that is displayed, which you'll need to configure collectd.

### Install and Configure collectd
You'll now SSH into the Splunk instance to run all the following commands and configurations.

- Let's start by installing collectd, run `sudo apt-get install collectd`
- Let's edit the collectd configuration file located at `/etc/collectd/collectd.conf`
- In this file, include the following configuration section. Make sure you replace the `SPLUNK_HOST` and `SPLUNK_AUTH` with the proper values. You have this information prom the previous section when you were configuring HEC.

```
<Plugin cpu>
  ReportByCpu true
</Plugin>
<Plugin memory>
    ValuesAbsolute true
    ValuesPercentage true
</Plugin>

LoadPlugin write_http
<Plugin write_http>
    <Node "node1">
        URL "https://{{SPLUNK_HOST}}:8088/services/collector/raw"
        Header "Authorization: Splunk {{SPLUNK_AUTH}}"
        Format "JSON"
        VerifyPeer false
        VerifyHost false
        Metrics true
        StoreRates true
    </Node>
</Plugin>
LoadPlugin logfile
<Plugin logfile>
    LogLevel info
    File "/var/log/collectd.log"
    Timestamp true
    PrintSeverity false
</Plugin>
```
- Restart the collectd daemon with `/etc/init.d/collectd restart`
- Let's wait a little bit and then run the following search

```
| mstats avg(_value) prestats=t WHERE index=metrics AND metric_name="cpu.*" span=1m by metric_name
| timechart avg(_value) as "Avg" span=1m by metric_name
```

- Click on "Visualization" to confirm that new data is coming
- Play around with the time "Presets" to more detailed data
