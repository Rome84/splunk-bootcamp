# Search Examples
Time: 20 minutes

## Instructions
Let's start doing simple searches in Splunk by applying the concepts we've reviewed so far. Instead of you just copy/paste search queries, this time you'll create yours based on the data from the main index (the data that Eventgen is sending).

### Calculate Data Size
By running the following query, **which fields are the ones consuming more disk space?** You can take a look to the reference links to learn in more detail what these commands do. **Which is the command that's allowing you to see only certain fields in the results?**

```
index=_internal earliest=-15m latest=now
| fieldsummary 
| rex field=values max_match=0 "value\":\"(?<values>[^\"]*)\","
| mvexpand values 
| eval bytes=len(values)
| rex field=field "^(?!date|punct|host|hostip|index|linecount|source|sourcetype|timeendpos|timestartpos|splunk_server)(?<FieldName>.*)"
| stats count sum(bytes) as SumOfBytesInField values(values) as Values max(bytes) as MaxFieldLengthInBytes by FieldName
| rename count as NumOfValuesPerField
| eventstats sum(NumOfValuesPerField) as TotalEvents sum(SumOfBytesInField) as TotalBytes
| eval PercentOfTotalEvents=round(NumOfValuesPerField/TotalEvents*100,2)
| eval PercentOfTotalBytes=round(SumOfBytesInField/TotalBytes*100,2)
| eval ConsumedMB=SumOfBytesInField/1024/1024
| eval TotalMB=TotalBytes/1024/1024
| table FieldName NumOfValuesPerField SumOfBytesInField ConsumedMB PercentOfTotalBytes PercentOfTotalEvents
| addcoltotals labelfield=FieldName label=Totals
| sort - PercentOfTotalEvents
```

### Add Comments to Searches
When a search is not returning the results you want, you can use comments to identify the problem by looking how's the data being indexed before applying a command to the search. So this time, you need to do the following:

- Create a simple search to display events with destinations to NY and MIA. Include a comment indicating which is the field that you're using to filter.
- Same as before, but for AK or LAX
- Same as before, but where the destination is not SEA
- Create a search using different operators than the previous ones
