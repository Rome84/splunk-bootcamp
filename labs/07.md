# Search Examples II
Time: 30 minutes

## Instructions
This time, instead of copying and pasting queries, you'll try to do the searches on your own. You can ask questions or reread the information from the slide deck. (In the notes, you'll find the links to the official docs.)

### Time Ranges
Using the data you uploaded previously in lab #3, answer the following questions (you might not need to create complex queries if you inspect all the elements in the screen):

- What's the top referrer site?
- What's the period of time for the data?
- How many events are for today?
- How many events are per day?
- How many events are between days two and three? Use relative time range dates

If you want, you can save each search. We'll talk about that later. But just in case you finish early...;)

### Using the Search App
Now, this time, try to use the Search app or the UI to answer the questions below. Even better if you can create the queries from scratch, but start slowly by using the UI.

- What are the different category ids?
- How many events are for the sports category?
- Inspect the data and search for the errors that have occurred in the site. How many events did you find?
- What's the most common error event? Look for patterns.
- How many events did you find for access logs?
- Include the `action`, `categoryId`, and `productId` fields in the search results table
- What's the `action` that has fewer events?
- How many successful (status = 200) purchases are for yesterday?
- How many failed purchases are for yesterday?
- How many successful (status = 200) purchases are for the sports category two days ago?
