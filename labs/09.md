## Instructions
It's time to keep practicing. This time, it's your turn to be creative. The idea is that you create searches by using the most common commands. Feel free to add more queries if you finish early.

### Upload data
Let's use some data from FIFA. Upload the file for [soccer rankings](../data/fifa-international-soccer-mens-ranking-1993now.zip).

### Using Search Commands
