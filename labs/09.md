# Search Examples III
Time: 30 minutes

## Instructions
It's time to keep practicing, this time it's your turn to be creative. The idea is that you create searches based on the data that Evengen is sending to Splunk or the data you've uploaded manually. Each task indicates which command you'd need to use. There's no wrong answer.

### Using Search Commands

- Use the AND command
- Use the OR command
- Use the AND and OR commands together
- Use the top command
- Use the eval command
- Use brackets to include a subsearch
- Use a subsearch with a NOT command
- Use the stats command to include the min, avg, and max numbers
- Use the chart command to see something in the "Visualizations" tab
- Include wildcards in a search
