# Dashboards
Time: 30 minutes

## Instructions
There are going to be times where you'd need to have a graphic to represent the status of your systems. You can save any search as a chart, and combine it with other widgets like searches or reports. The purpose is that you can have several critical monitoring pieces in one place.

### Saving Searches
For the following search query:

```
sourcetype=access_* status=200 action=purchase [search sourcetype=access_* status=200 action=purchase | top limit=1 clientip | table clientip] | stats count AS "Total Purchased", dc(productId) AS "Total Products", values(productName) AS "Product Names" BY clientip | rename clientip AS "VIP Customer"
```

- Save the search as a report
- Configure a time range picker
- Edit the permissions of the report to share it with everyone

### Create a Report from a Chart
For the following serach query:

```
sourcetype=access_* | timechart count(eval(action="purchase")) by productName usenull=f useother=f
```

- In the Visualizations tab, pick "Line Chart"
- Change the format so legends are visible in the chart
- Save as a report

### Create Dashboards
For the following search query (if there's no data, it could be because of the time range selected):

```
sourcetype=access_* status=200 action=purchase | top categoryId
```

- Click the "Visualization" tab, and change it to a "Pie Chart"
- Save it as a private dashboard panel
- Set a dashboard and panel title
- Click on "Edit" and click on "+ Add Input"
- Select "Time"
- Edit the input and set a label name
- For "Token" type `BG_Purchases_Time_Range`
- For "Default" change it to `Previous Week`
- Click on "Apply"

Now let's edit the search query for the visualization:

- In the Dashboard panel, click on "Edit Search" (at top-left corner's chart)
- In the "Time Range" section, change "Use time picker" to the one you just created before (BG_Purchases_Time_Range)
- Click on "Apply"
- Click on "Save"
- Make sure everything is working by using different time ranges

It's time to add more panels to the dashboard:

- Add at least one saved reports (chart) from the ones you've created previously
- Add at least one saved search (table) from the ones you've created previously
