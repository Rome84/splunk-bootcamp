# Add Input Forms
Time: 30 minutes

## Instructions
Once you have dashboard panels, you might need to have fields to update the data you see, for debugging purposes mainly. In this lab, you'll be adding more inputs to dasbhoard panels besides the one you've added in the previous lab. You'll apply the `Token` concept in the search queries.

### Add a Static Dropdown Option
Based on the data you have indexed, think about which field you could use as a dropdown option. For example, the product id.

- Edit the dashboard panel you created in the previous lab
- Add a dropdown input for the `productId` field, and make sure you fill in the "Static Options" section. Add static options like "DB-SG-G01" and "WC-SH-GO4"
- Make sure you include an option that include all options, like a "Sellect All"
- Edit the search query from the pie chart to include this input field
- Make sure that the search works by changing the options in the dropdown field

The new search query for the pie chart should look like this:

```
sourcetype=access_* status=200 productId=$productid$ | top categoryId
```

### Add a Dynamic Dropdown Option
There are times where you'd like to filter based on the values from one of the fields you have in the data. In this case, let's use the `action` field, and instead of statically specifying the "purchases" value in the search query, use the value from a dynamic dropdown.

Use this search query to populate the dropdown:

```
* | stats count by action | eval label=action." (".count.")"
```

- Add a dropdown input, and make sure you fill in the "Dynamic Options" section with the search query from above.
- Make sure you include an option that include all options, like a "Sellect All"
- Scroll down a little bit, in the "Field For Lable" type `label`, and in the "Field For Value" type `action`.
- Click on "Apply"
- Edit the search query from the pie chart to include this input field (it's alreay included, so you need to use the token now)
- Make sure that the search works by changing the options in the dropdown field

The new search query for the pie chart should look like this:

```
sourcetype=access_* status=200 productId=$productid$ action=$actionid$ | top categoryId
```
