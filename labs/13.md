# Alerts
Time: 30 minutes

## Instructions
There are going to be times when you'll need to get alerts and take action, either for security reasons or because you'll need to fix something in the systems. For this type of things Splunk has alerts, and in this lab you'll create a few of them to practice.

### Create a Scheduled Alert
Create an alert that search for events on a regular scheduled. To do it, you need to do the following:

- Create or use an existing saved search
- Select "Save As > Alert"
- Type the title of the alert, description and specify permissions
- Configure the aler schedule
- Select an action (eg. email)
- Click on "Save"

It doesn't matter if it's hard to trigger the alarm or the action doesn't work. The purpose of this lab is that you know how to create alerts. Maybe the trigger is complex or the email configuration is missing.

### Create More Alerts
For the following tasks, you'll need to pay close attention to the details in the alerts form to configure the alert properly. Make sure you're configuring the email action in each alert.

- Create a scheduled alert using cron
- Create a real-time triggered by "per-result"
- Create a real-time triggered by a rolling window (eg. number of hosts or results)
