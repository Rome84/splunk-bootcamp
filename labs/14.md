## Instructions
At this time you've already created, edited, and saved a few searches. You've also have created at least one Dashboard panel. Now it's time for you to create a scheduled report for those people that don't have time to see any report on daily basis. By using schedule reports, you might be able to send crucial information to C-level executives only when they need. Or maybe you'd like to send reports of your system to certain customers.

You can create reports via Splunk Web four ways:

1. From Search, by saving a search as a report.
2. From Pivot, by saving a pivot as a report.
3. By navigating to Settings > Searches, reports, and alerts and clicking New to add a new report.
4. From a dashboard, by converting an inline-search-powered dashboard panel to a report.

### Schedule Report from a Saved Search
Choose a saved search you've already created or you can create a new one, just to keep practicing. After choosing a saved search, **schedule it as a report that will be sent daily at 6pm.**

### Schedule Report from a Dashboard
Choose an existing Dashboard, or create a new one. Then, **schedule it as a report that will be sent on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 8am.**
